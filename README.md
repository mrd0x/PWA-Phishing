# Progressive Web App (PWA) Phishing

A PWA Phishing template which was explained here: [https://mrd0x.com/progressive-web-apps-pwa-phishing](https://mrd0x.com/progressive-web-apps-pwa-phishing).

## Attack Scenario

A user lands on `index.html` and clicks the "Install Microsoft Application" button. The install app prompt appears and once it is installed by the user, the JavaScript embedded in `index.html` redirects the PWA window to the phishing page that hase a fake URL bar at the top (i.e. `mrd0x.html`).
